    <h1> About Me! </h1>
      <p> My Background </p>
      <h4> My name is Radeen Hami. Both my Mom and my Dad are 100% Iranian, born in Iran. However, me and my older brother were born in Vancouver, Canada. We lived there for five more years after I was born before coming down to San Diego and starting a new life here.  </h4>

      <p> My Travel Life </p>
      <h4> I travel a lot, mainly during the Summer and Winter break. I have been to many different countries including: Canada, Iran, China, Japan, Turkey, Austria, Mexico, United Kingdom, and United Arab Emirates. My favorite country in terms of entertainment has been Japan, however my favorite country in terms of food has been Turkey. My dream vacation would be somewhere with clear water and a nice beach, like the Bahamas. I am going to Switzerland this summer too! </h4>
